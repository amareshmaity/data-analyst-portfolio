# Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. **High churn rates** directly impact **revenue, profitability, and long-term growth**.

This project focuses on analyzing customer-level data from the **IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset** to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition. The dataset contains information related to customer demographics, subscribed services, billing information, and churn status.

The primary objective of this analysis is to **identify key drivers of customer churn** and provide **actionable insights** that can support data-driven customer retention strategies.

- Understand how services, contracts, and billing patterns influence churn
- Quantify churn rates across demographic and behavioral dimensions
- Support decision-making for targeted retention programs
