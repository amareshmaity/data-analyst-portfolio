| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| new    |  0 ≤ x<=6            | high risky as they are still evaluating the service |
| midterm | x<=24               | moderate risk as they have some experience with the service |
| longterm | 24+       | low risk as they have established loyalty to the service.|
