# Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. High churn rates directly impact revenue, profitability, and long-term growth.

This project focuses on analyzing customer-level data from the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition. The dataset contains information related to customer demographics, subscribed services, account details, billing information, and churn status.

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify key drivers of customer churn and provide actionable insights that can support data-driven customer retention strategies.
