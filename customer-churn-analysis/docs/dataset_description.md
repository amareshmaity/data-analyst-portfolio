# Dataset Description

The **IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset** contains customer-level information from a fictional telecommunications company. Each row represents a single customer, and each column describes an attribute related to the customer’s demographics, subscribed services, account details, billing information, and churn status.

The primary purpose of the dataset is to analyze customer behavior and identify factors that influence customer churn (i.e., customers who discontinue their service).

This dataset is widely used in the industry and academia for customer retention analysis, churn analytics, and business intelligence use cases.
